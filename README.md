## Project Details:

### Project 1: Mad Lib Game
Overview:
This project is a simple word game that allows users to create a fun story by filling in blanks with their own words, such as nouns, adjectives, and body parts. It demonstrates the basics of user input and string formatting.

Expectations:

Collect user input for specified types of words (e.g., nouns, adjectives).
Display a story template filled in with the user’s responses.
Reinforce skills in user interaction and basic string manipulation.

Notes:
Prompt the player for input
Combine the player's inputs into the story template
Print the completed story

### Project 2: Lottery Number Generator
Overview:
This project generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket, allowing users to pick five numbers between 1 and 69, plus one number between 1 and 26. It uses the random module to simulate the lottery drawing.

Expectations:

Generate and display six random numbers (five white balls and one red ball).
Separate the last number from the others for clarity.
Practice using Python’s random module and basic print formatting.

Notes:
Import the random module to use the randint function for generating random numbers
Display a greeting message to the user
Generate five random numbers between 1 and 69 for the white balls
Generate a random number between 1 and 26 for the red PowerBall
Format the output with spaces between the numbers
First five numbers have one space between them, followed by three spaces before the PowerBall number
Display a farewell message to the user
